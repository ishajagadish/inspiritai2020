Project Title: Using AI to Detect Pneumonia in Chest X-Rays

In the summer of 2020, I attended the Inspirit AI program led by Stanford PhD students and researchers. I learned about AI and Machine Learning specifically as applied to Healthcare by working on a project entitled “Using AI to Detect Pneumonia in Chest X-Rays”. We used a convolutional neural network to determine if images were classified as “healthy” or “diseased”. We started out using three models: K-nearest-neighbors classifier, logistic regression, and decision tree. With these, we only obtained an accuracy of approximately 80%. We then used a dense classifier with many hidden layers and this resulted in an accuracy of approximately 99%. We also utilized transfer learning and used 4 previously-trained models: DenseNet121, VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50. DenseNet121 performed the best, obtaining an accuracy of 99.6%.
